# Flower-Recognition-Using-CNN
The Flower Recognition program uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification. It enables users to input images of flowers, which the model then identifies and classifies into specific categories. This project reinforces concepts in deep learning, image processing, and the practical application of CNNs in computer vision tasks.
